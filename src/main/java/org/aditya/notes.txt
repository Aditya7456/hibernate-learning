HQL - Hibernate Query Language
* we need this when we want to filter the data based on some complex variable,
* offcourse we can use SQL also in that case it is called native query,
* so here we will use HQL.

like in sql if we want to select all data -> select * from student;
but in hql if we want to select all data -> from Student;
