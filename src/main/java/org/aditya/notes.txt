HQL - Hibernate Query Language
* we need this when we want to filter the data based on some complex variable,
* offcourse we can use SQL also in that case it is called native query,
* so here we will use HQL.

like in sql if we want to select all data -> select * from student;
in sql we use tablename
but in hql if we want to select all data -> from Student;
in hql we use entity or ClassName

* in jdbc query result gives us resultSet
* in hibernate query return the resultList of entity type only

/* Eager loading -> session.get(Laptop.class, 1);
    * it will load data even if we print or not.
/* Lazy Loading ->  session.getReference(Laptop.class, 1);
    * it will now load data until we use it.
